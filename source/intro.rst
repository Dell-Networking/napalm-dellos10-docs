This information explains the usage of NAPALM for deploying the configuration into Dell EMC Networking OS10 switches.

NAPALM
******

Network automation and programmability abstraction layer with multivendor support (NAPALM) is a Python library that implements a set of functions to interact with different network device operating systems using a unified API.

NAPALM tries to provide a common interface and mechanisms to push configuration and retrieve state data from network devices. This method is very useful in combination with tools such as Ansible/SaltStack, which allow you to manage a set of
devices independent of their network OS.

See `NAPALM <https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html>`_ for complete information.

Dell EMC Networking NAPALM integration
**************************************

Dell EMC Networking OS10 switches can be managed and automated using NAPALM unified API to manipulate configurations or to retrieve data.
